# build a chair

@software guys

hop on google, right now. google 'adirondack chair'.

do you think you could make that? like, today? if not, google 'pallet chair'.

you should definitely be able to make that, right?

maybe add 'how to make' to the end of your search if you're feeling a little helpless, but maybe you want to go at this blind, like an explorer.

hack and hammer and drill away - tools are cheap, second hand tools particularly so. same as scrap wood.

get something you can sit in, don't go crazy, just something you're proud enough of not to want to burn down

then sit in the chair

don't look at it and think about what you could improve

don't think about iterating, and how you'll change the next chair you make

don't think about updating the dependencies of the chair

use the chair for its intended purposes, to relax for a few minutes before you tidy up, never to consider the chair as a "project" again, just a piece of furniture.

finished.

the real key here is finished.
